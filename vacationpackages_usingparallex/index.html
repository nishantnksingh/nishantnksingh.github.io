    <p>You might feel like you’re stuck in a rut in your daily life. Or you’re yearning for something exciting and different. You’re craving new experiences and new challenges. Travel is the ideal place to test yourself. It pushes people to their limits and gets them outside their comfort zone. You’ll discover how resourceful you are when you’re exposed to new places, people and experiences. Maybe it’s finding your way around a busy city. Or ordering a meal when you don’t speak the language. Or zip-lining. You’ll feel pride when you finish your trip successfully. Overcoming challenges will bring you joy and energy for future tests. You’ll realize how capable you are and build your confidence.

        Learning.
        Learning is a strong reason why people love to travel.  They want to experience something unfamiliar and leave with new skills or knowledge. Seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college class. This condensed crash course in discovering how the rest of the world lives actually will cover subjects like history, geography and sociology. Every destination has something unique to teach visitors, and immersing themselves in a completely different world is the best learning experience.
        
        People may travel to learn something specific: a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different culture, or a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality. As a bonus, they’ll take away more than their specific goal. They’ll discover totally different ways of doing things. They’ll also gain awareness of new customs, cultures, people and places. And because you’re actually experiencing this learning in real life, not reading it in a textbook, it will stay with you for a long time. You’ll gain a deep sense of satisfaction with the new skills you’ve learned – and new insights you’ve gained.</p>

    <p>The Maldives is one of the most unique holiday destinations in the world! A vast underwater mountain range makes up the country, less than 4% of which breaks the water’s surface. The visible tips of the range form over 1000 low-lying islands. Roughly 200 of these islands are inhabited, and nearly 100 of them have been developed as luxury tourist resorts.

        The Maldives is located in the Indian Ocean, at the top of the equator. The country enjoys year-round warm weather and a consistent average temperature of 28°C. Water temperatures range between 26°C – 29°C and, when combined with the abundance of tropical fish, marine life, and iconic over-water bungalows, the Maldives is an ideal holiday destination for all water-lovers!</p>
